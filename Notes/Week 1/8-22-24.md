The high in each of these columns is called a record

- The data that needs to be sorted is called Keys (Column to be sorted)
- The data surrounding the key is called satellite data (All other columns)

## Pseudocode Conventions
indentation indicates block structure
loop counters retain value after the loop is exited
- "to" means to increment by 1
- "down to" means decrement by 1

Unless otherwise specified, all variables are local
Subarray A[i,j] includes both A[i] and A[j]
Use dot notation for the attributes of objects
All object/array variables are treated as pointers
For all attrubtes f of an obhect x, setting x = y causes x.f=y.f
- x.f.g = (x.f).g
- the non-object gets the special value NIL

Pass value parameters by value
- calling procedure receives it's own local copy

Arrays and Objects are passed via pointer
- Changes to the elements are visible to the calling procedure

Return statement immediately transfers control back to the point of call in calling procedure
Multiple values may be returned without requiring packaging
Boolean operators "short circuit"
- F && _ = F
- T || _ = T

If an error is returned, the process terminates

## Insertion Sort
Assume array of size(n) that needs to be sorted
*Psuedocode (indexing from 1!!!):*
```
for i = 2 to n
    key = A[i]
    // Insert A[i] into the sorted subarray A[1:i - 1]
    j = i - 1
    while j > 0 and A[j] > key
        A[j + 1] = A[j]
        j = j - 1
    A[j + 1] = key
```

*Example:*
*insertion_sort*([10,7,6,5,10], 5)
i = 2
key = 7
j = 1
A[2] = 10
j = 0
A[1] = 7
So after this is run, the array will be: [7,10,6,5,10]

next step of the sort:
i = 3 
key = 6
j = 2
A[3] = 10
j = 1
A[2] = 7
j = 0
A[1] = 6
So after this is run, the array will be: [6,7,10,5,10]

next step of the sort:
i = 4
key = 5
j = 3
A[4] = 10
j = 2
A[3] = 7
j = 1
A[2] = 6
j = 0
A[1] = 5
So after this run, they array will be: [5,6,7,10,10]

- Notice that the for loop is the dividing marker (i value) between they already sorted and those left to be sorted.
- A = [1,2,2,3,3,3,10,1,7,3,8]; i=7
- At the i^th^ step, A[1,(i-1)] is a sorted list. This is a loop invariant  

Loop invariants verify correctness of code:
- Initialization(base case): Show that the loop invariant is true prior to the first iteration of the loop
- Maintenance(inductive step): Show that if the loop invariant was true prior to the i^th^ iteration of the loop, it remains true after
- Termination(correctness): Show that loop terminates and when it does, the loop invariant gives the solution to the problem
