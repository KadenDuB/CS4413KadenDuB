# Chapter 1: Why Study Algorithms?
## To solve problems!
Recognize the available solutions which might appropriately solve the problem

Being able to weigh the cost of algorithm (efficiency) to find the "best solution"

Being able to show that your algorithm does the right thing

Fitting the problem into the necessary framework to solve the problem/use the algorithm

Even those problems for which no efficient algorithm exists (NP-complete)
- recognize the problem so that you don't waste time trying to find an efficient algorithm
- approximation algorithms that get us close enough to the solution
- ways to add an assumption to simplify the problem enough to use an existing algorithm

## Because improvements in technology can only take us so far!
A bad algorithm on a good computer can be much worse than a good algortihm on a decent computer

But what about machine learning?
- Machine learning does well in situations where no known algorithm exists
- For algorithmic problems that humans can solve/understand well, efficient algorithms that are designed for the problem are typically more successful

## What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a well-defined computational procedure that takes in inputs and returns output(s) in a finite amount of time

A (well specified) computational problem specifies, in general terms, the desired input/output relationship for all problem instances (typically on arbitrarily sized inputs)

An algorithm is **correct** if for every problem instance if:
- It outputs the correct response
- It halts (finishes computing in a finite time)

A correct algorithm solves the problem

## Sorting Problem
Input: a sequence of n numbers [a~1~, ... , a~n~]
Output: a sequence of n numbers [a~1~', ... , a~n~'] is a reordering of the input sequence with a~1~' < a~2~' < ... < a~n~'

Given: <1>
- Expect: <1>

Given: <1,3,2>
- Expect: <1,2,3>

Given: <2,3,2>
- Expect: <2,2,3>

Given: <5,4,3,2,1>
- Expect: <1,2,3,4,5>

We will measure the efficiency of algorithms by studying the asymptotic behavior of the running time of the algorithm (number of instructions and data accesses executed) beased on input size of an instance

Asymptotic behavior is the growth of the runtime function as n approaches infinity
