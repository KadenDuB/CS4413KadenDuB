# Chapter 2: Algorithm Anaysis (Part 2)
## Loop Invariant for Insertion Sort
Psuedocode:
```
for i = 2 to n
    key = A[i]
    // Insert A[i] into the sorted subarray A[1:i - 1]
    j = i - 1
    while j > 0 and A[j] > key
        A[j + 1] = A[j]
        j = j - 1
    A[j + 1] = key
```
Initialization(base case):
- i = 2; A[1:2-1] = A[1] is just a single element, so it is sorted
- true

Maintenance(inductive step):
- Let i be arbitrary and assume A[1:i-1] is a sorted list
- J stays inside the already sorted list
- If key < some A[j]: The algorithm puts the sorted element one spot to the right, continue moving through the list shifting elements UNTIL either j = 0 or key > some A[j]
- Everything to the left of key is necessarily smaller (or equal key). Similarly everything to the right of the key is necessarily bigger. Therefore A[1:i] is sorted.

Termination(correctness)
- The for loop terminates when i = n + 1
- At this point, the loop invariant says A[1:(n+1)-1] = A[1:n] is a sorted list

Computational Assumptions: Single-processor RAM model 
- Instructions execute sequentially (no concurrent operations)
- Each instruction and data access takes the same amount of time
- Contain arithmetic operations, data movement and contol instructions
- Contains data types integer, floating point, and character with a limit on size (number of bits allocated)
- Ignore memory hierarchy and existence of additional instructions

The input size is the number of items to be sorted, the number of bits needed to represent the numbers, the number of datum needed to represent input, etc.

The runtime of an algorithm, denote T(n), on a particular input size is the number of instructions and accesses executed
- We'll assume that the amount of time to execute line k of code is constant c~k~
